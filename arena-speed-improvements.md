# Arena Audio Connection Speed Improvements

## Problem
- Arena audio connections were taking 30-45 seconds
- Users would abandon the app due to slow connection times
- Random mute/unmute loops were occurring

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. ICE Server Prioritization
**Changed in**: `lib/services/livekit_service.dart` and `lib/services/persistent_audio_service.dart`

**Before**:
```dart
iceServers: [
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['stun:stun.l.google.com:19302']),  // STUN first
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80']),  // UDP TURN
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['turn:openrelay.metered.ca:443?transport=tcp']),  // TCP TURN
],
iceCandidatePoolSize: 10,
```

**After**:
```dart
iceServers: [
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['turn:openrelay.metered.ca:443?transport=tcp']),  // TCP TURN first
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80']),  // UDP TURN
  RTCIceServer(urls: ['stun:stun.l.google.com:19302']),  // STUN fallback
],
iceCandidatePoolSize: 0,  // On-demand gathering
```

**Benefits**:
- TCP TURN is more reliable through corporate firewalls
- On-demand ICE gathering reduces initial connection delay
- STUN as fallback reduces timeout delays

### 2. Connection Timing Monitoring
**Added in**: `lib/services/livekit_service.dart`

```dart
final stopwatch = Stopwatch()..start();
// ... connection code ...
AppLogger().debug('âœ… Connected to LiveKit room in ${stopwatch.elapsedMilliseconds}ms');
```

**Benefits**:
- Track actual connection performance
- Identify if optimizations are working
- Target: < 5000ms for good user experience

### 3. Disabled Aggressive Mute Sync
**Fixed in**: `lib/screens/arena_screen.dart`

**Before**:
```dart
_startMuteStateSyncTimer(); // 2-second timer causing loops
```

**After**:
```dart
// _startMuteStateSyncTimer(); // Disabled - was causing mute/unmute loops
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates random mute/unmute behavior
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic
- Improves audio stability

## Expected Results

### Connection Speed
- **Before**: 30-45 seconds
- **Target**: 2-5 seconds
- **Max Acceptable**: 10 seconds

### User Experience
- No more random mute/unmute issues
- Faster room joining
- More reliable audio through firewalls

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test Arena room joining on different networks
- [ ] Monitor console for connection timing logs
- [ ] Verify no random mute/unmute behavior
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Test through corporate firewalls/restrictive networks

## Monitoring

Watch for these console logs:
```
ðŸ”„ Connection attempt 1/3 to room: arena-123
âœ… Connected to LiveKit room in 3245ms
```

If connection still takes > 10 seconds, consider:
1. Using a dedicated TURN server closer to users
2. Implementing progressive connection (join room first, audio second)
3. Adding connection progress indicators
