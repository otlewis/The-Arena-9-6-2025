### Adding New Analytics

1. Extend the appropriate analytics class
2. Add new methods following the existing patterns
3. Update the MCP server tool definitions
4. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify Appwrite endpoint and credentials

2. **Missing Data**
   - Ensure all required collections exist in Appwrite
   - Verify API key has read permissions for all collections

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Consider adding database indexes for large datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Debug Mode

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment for detailed logging:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start
```

## Roadmap
