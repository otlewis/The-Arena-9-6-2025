- Products must be approved before going live
- Always test thoroughly with sandbox accounts first
- Keep receipt validation for security
- Handle all purchase states (pending, success, error, canceled)

## 6. Revenue Split

- Apple takes 30% (15% after year 1 for subscriptions)
- Google takes 30% (15% after year 1 for subscriptions)
- Your $10/month becomes ~$7/month after fees
