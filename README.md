### Key Design Patterns
- **Provider Pattern** - Riverpod for reactive state management
- **Repository Pattern** - Clean data access layer
- **Factory Pattern** - Service instantiation and dependency injection
- **Observer Pattern** - Real-time updates and state synchronization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (2.17.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- iOS development: Xcode (for iOS builds)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd arena
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update Appwrite endpoint and project credentials
   - Configure Agora app ID and tokens

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
AGORA_APP_ID=your-agora-app-id
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing infrastructure:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests** - Business logic and service layer testing
- **Widget Tests** - UI component testing with mock dependencies
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end user workflow testing

## 📱 Key Components

### Arena System
The arena is the core debate environment where users engage in structured debates:

- **Arena Provider** (`lib/features/arena/providers/arena_provider.dart`)
  - Manages arena state and real-time updates
  - Handles user roles and permissions
  - Coordinates debate phases and timing

- **Arena Screen** (`lib/features/arena/screens/arena_screen_modular.dart`)
  - Main debate interface with responsive layout
  - Integrates voice chat, messaging, and controls
  - Supports both mobile and tablet layouts

- **Arena Widgets**
  - `arena_debate_controls.dart` - Speaking controls and phase management
  - `arena_participants_panel.dart` - User roles and participant display
  - `arena_chat_panel.dart` - Real-time messaging interface

### Voice Integration
Real-time voice communication using Agora Voice SDK:

- **Agora Service** (`lib/services/agora_service_mobile.dart`)
  - Cross-platform voice implementation
  - Dynamic token generation for security
  - Role-based audio permissions (speaker/audience)

### Challenge System
Debate invitation and matchmaking system:

- **Challenge Messaging Service** (`lib/services/challenge_messaging_service.dart`)
  - Real-time challenge delivery
  - Automatic room creation and role assignment
  - Judge and moderator invitation system

## 🔧 Development

### Code Style
- Follow Dart/Flutter style guidelines
- Use `flutter analyze` for static analysis
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document public APIs with dart doc comments

### Debugging
The application includes comprehensive logging:

```dart
// Use AppLogger for structured logging
AppLogger().debug('Debug information');
AppLogger().info('Important events');
AppLogger().warning('Potential issues');
AppLogger().error('Error conditions');
```

### Performance
- Optimized database queries with connection pooling
- Efficient state management with selective rebuilds
- Image caching and lazy loading
- Voice chat with bandwidth optimization

## 🛠️ Services Integration

### Appwrite Backend
- **Authentication** - User registration and login
- **Database** - Real-time data storage and sync
- **Storage** - File uploads for avatars and assets
- **Functions** - Server-side logic for complex operations

### Agora Voice SDK
- **Real-time Audio** - Low-latency voice communication
- **Token Security** - Dynamic token generation
- **Role Management** - Speaker/audience role switching
