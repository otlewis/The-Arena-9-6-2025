# Audio Conflict Resolution - MediaSoup vs LiveKit

## Problem Identified
Users were experiencing inconsistent audio issues in Arena:
- Some users could hear and talk fine
- Others could only hear but not talk
- Microphone access was inconsistent

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **multiple WebRTC services competing for audio resources**:

1. **LiveKit Service** - Used by main Arena screen (`/lib/screens/arena_screen.dart`)
2. **MediaSoup Services** - Multiple unused services still present in codebase:
   - `SmartWebRTCService` (used by `/lib/features/arena/screens/arena_screen.dart`)
   - `HttpMediasoupService`
   - `MediasoupSFUService` 
   - `SimpleMediasoupService`
   - `ProperMediasoupService`
   - `NativeMediasoupService`

When both LiveKit and MediaSoup tried to access the microphone simultaneously, it caused audio conflicts where:
- Some users got LiveKit microphone access (could talk)
- Others got MediaSoup microphone access (but MediaSoup wasn't properly configured)
- Result: Inconsistent audio experience

## Solution Applied
**Disabled all MediaSoup services and ensured ONLY LiveKit is used:**

### Services Disabled:
```
smart_webrtc_service.dart -> smart_webrtc_service.dart.disabled
http_mediasoup_service.dart -> http_mediasoup_service.dart.disabled
mediasoup_sfu_service.dart -> mediasoup_sfu_service.dart.disabled
simple_mediasoup_service.dart -> simple_mediasoup_service.dart.disabled
proper_mediasoup_service.dart -> proper_mediasoup_service.dart.disabled2
native_mediasoup_service.dart -> native_mediasoup_service.dart.disabled
sfu_webrtc_service.dart -> sfu_webrtc_service.dart.disabled
websocket_webrtc_service.dart -> websocket_webrtc_service.dart.disabled
http_webrtc_service.dart -> http_webrtc_service.dart.disabled
```

### Widgets/Screens Disabled:
```
/lib/features/arena/screens/arena_screen.dart -> arena_screen.dart.disabled
/lib/widgets/mediasoup_video_panel.dart -> mediasoup_video_panel.dart.disabled
```

### Import Fixes:
- Updated `arena_role_notification_modal.dart` to use main ArenaScreen (LiveKit) instead of ArenaScreenModular (MediaSoup)
- Updated comment in main arena screen to reflect LiveKit usage

## Result
- **Single WebRTC Stack**: Only LiveKit is now used for all Arena audio
- **No Resource Conflicts**: Eliminates competition for microphone access
- **Consistent Audio Experience**: All users should now have reliable audio
- **Clean Codebase**: Removed unused conflicting services

## Technical Benefits
1. **Simplified Architecture**: One WebRTC solution instead of multiple
2. **Better Reliability**: No race conditions for audio resources  
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single service to manage and debug
4. **Consistent Performance**: Same audio stack for all users

## Testing Priority
After this fix, focus testing on:
1. **All participants can unmute/mute consistently**
2. **No more "some can talk, others can only hear" issues**
3. **Audio quality is consistent across all roles**
4. **No microphone access conflicts**

## Future Maintenance
- Keep only LiveKit service for Arena audio
- Do not re-enable MediaSoup services unless completely removing LiveKit
- If adding new WebRTC features, extend LiveKit service instead of creating new ones
