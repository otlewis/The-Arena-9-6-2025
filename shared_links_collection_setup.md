## Permissions

Set the following permissions on the collection:

**Read**: 
- `any()` - Anyone can read shared links

**Create**: 
- `users` - Only authenticated users can create links

**Update**: 
- `users` - Users can update their own links (handled by document-level permissions)

**Delete**: 
- `users` - Users can delete their own links (handled by document-level permissions)

## Document-Level Permissions

When creating documents, the app sets permissions so:
- Anyone can read the shared link
- Only the creator can update/delete their link

## Setting Up via Appwrite Console

1. Go to your Appwrite Console
2. Navigate to Database â†’ `arena_db`
3. Create new collection with ID `shared_links`
4. Add all the attributes listed above
5. Create the indexes as specified
6. Set collection permissions as outlined
7. Test by creating a sample document

## Usage in App

The SharedLinksService handles all CRUD operations for this collection:

```dart
// Share a link
await sharedLinksService.shareLink(
  roomId: 'room_123',
  url: 'https://example.com',
  title: 'Example Link',
);

// Subscribe to real-time updates
sharedLinksService.subscribeToSharedLinks('room_123');

// Remove a link
await sharedLinksService.deactivateLink(linkId);
```
