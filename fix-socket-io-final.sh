echo "üîß Final Socket.IO Fix - Downgrade to v2.x"
echo ""
echo "The Flutter socket_io_client v3.x has a bug where it ignores transport settings."
echo "The solution is to downgrade to v2.x which properly respects polling-only configuration."
echo ""
echo "üìã Steps to fix:"
echo ""
echo "1. Update pubspec.yaml:"
echo "   Change: socket_io_client: ^3.0.2"
echo "   To:     socket_io_client: ^2.0.3+1"
echo ""
echo "2. Update imports if needed:"
echo "   The API is mostly the same between v2 and v3"
echo ""
echo "3. Run: flutter pub get"
echo ""
echo "4. Test the app - WebSocket errors should be gone!"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Why this works:"
echo "- v2.x properly respects the 'transports' configuration"
echo "- v2.x doesn't force WebSocket upgrades when polling is specified"
echo "- The server is already configured correctly (no upgrades offered)"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Alternative if downgrade isn't possible:"
echo "Use the custom PollingOnlySocketIO client we created"
