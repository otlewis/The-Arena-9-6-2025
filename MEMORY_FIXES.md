# Android Memory Crisis - Emergency Fixes Applied

## Critical Issue
**Error**: `pthread_create failed: couldn't mprotect R+W 1064960-byte thread mapping region: Out of memory`
**Impact**: Fatal crash when joining Arena rooms on Android devices
**Cause**: WebRTC native library exhausting available memory for thread creation

## Emergency Memory Optimizations Applied

### 1. LiveKit Service Memory Management (`lib/services/livekit_service.dart`)

#### Aggressive WebRTC Configuration
- **Reduced bitrate**: 32kbps audio (was default ~128kbps)
- **Disabled adaptive streaming**: Prevents memory spikes
- **Disabled dynacast**: Saves processing resources  
- **Minimal ICE servers**: Reduced from 10+ to 2 servers
- **Reduced ICE candidate pool**: From 20 to 2 candidates
- **Disabled E2EE**: Removes encryption overhead

#### Connection Retry with Memory Awareness
- **Shorter timeouts**: 25s/30s/35s instead of 45s/60s/75s
- **Memory error detection**: Detects pthread/memory errors specifically
- **Aggressive cleanup**: Force dispose and memory cleanup between retries
- **Extended cleanup delays**: 500ms additional cleanup time

#### Proactive Memory Management
- **Pre-connection check**: Memory cleanup before every connection
- **Periodic monitoring**: Every 2 minutes during connection
- **Speaking timer cleanup**: Remove expired timers automatically
- **Connection attempt tracking**: Monitor memory pressure patterns

### 2. Android Platform Optimizations

#### AndroidManifest.xml
- **Large heap enabled**: `android:largeHeap="true"`
- **Hardware acceleration**: `android:hardwareAccelerated="true"`
- **VM safe mode disabled**: `android:vmSafeMode="false"`

#### build.gradle
- **JVM heap size**: 2GB for build process
- **Disabled pre-dexing**: Reduces memory during build
- **Memory-aware build types**: Optimized for both debug/release

#### gradle.properties (already optimized)
- **4GB JVM args**: `-Xmx4096M`
- **Parallel builds enabled**: Better memory distribution

### 3. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Memory-Specific Error Detection
```dart
if (errorString.contains('out of memory') || 
    errorString.contains('pthread_create') ||
    errorString.contains('native crash')) {
  // Special memory error handling
}
```

#### User-Friendly Error Messages
- Clear guidance to close other apps
- Specific memory error notifications
- Restart recommendations for severe cases

### 4. Connection Optimization Strategy

#### Minimal Resource Approach
1. **Single STUN server**: Google's most reliable
2. **Single TURN server**: Primary Metered server only
3. **Reduced concurrent connections**: Minimize simultaneous WebRTC threads
4. **Audio-only focus**: Zero video processing overhead

#### Progressive Cleanup
1. **Immediate cleanup**: On any connection failure
2. **Aggressive disposal**: Full room disposal between retries
3. **State clearing**: All maps and timers cleared
4. **Memory monitoring**: Continuous cleanup during operation

## Expected Results

### Memory Usage Reduction
- **~60% fewer ICE servers**: Reduced connection overhead
- **~75% lower bitrate**: 32kbps vs 128kbps default
- **~40% fewer WebRTC features**: Disabled non-essential features
- **Continuous cleanup**: Prevents memory accumulation

### Improved Stability
- **Faster failure detection**: Memory errors caught immediately
- **Better error recovery**: Specific cleanup for memory issues
- **User guidance**: Clear instructions for memory constraints
- **Progressive degradation**: Graceful handling of low-memory conditions

## Emergency Usage Instructions

### For Users Experiencing Crashes
1. **Close all other apps** before joining Arena rooms
2. **Restart Arena app** if memory errors occur
3. **Restart phone** if crashes persist
4. **Use newer/higher-memory devices** for best experience

### For Developers
1. **Monitor crash logs** for pthread_create failures
2. **Test on low-memory devices** (2GB RAM or less)
3. **Check memory usage** during long Arena sessions
4. **Review connection patterns** for memory leaks

## Critical Implementation Notes

⚠️ **NEVER revert these optimizations** without extensive low-memory device testing
⚠️ **Monitor connection success rates** after deployment
⚠️ **Test on T-Mobile T790W Seattle_5G** (the device that crashed)
⚠️ **Consider progressive feature enablement** based on device memory
