## Technical Implementation

### Audio State Management
```dart
enum ParticipantStatus {
  joined,    // Unmuted and ready to speak
  muted,     // Microphone muted
  speaking,  // Actively speaking (with pulse animation)
  left       // Has left the room
}
```

### Key Components
1. **FloatingMicrophoneButton**: Main control for debaters
2. **MicrophoneControlButton**: Reusable mic button widget

## Production Integration

For real arena functionality, the system will:

1. **Detect Role Changes**: Automatically show/hide mic controls when users are moved to debater positions
2. **Audio Service Integration**: Connect to actual WebRTC/audio service
3. **Backend Sync**: Sync mute status with Appwrite database
4. **Real-time Updates**: Broadcast audio status to other participants
